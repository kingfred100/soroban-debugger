# Remote Protocol and Timeout Troubleshooting

This guide covers the most common remote-debugging failures across the CLI and the VS Code extension.

## Quick Matrix

| Symptom | Where you see it | Likely cause | What to try |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Request timed out | `soroban-debug remote`, VS Code session stalls, Debug Console | Backend is slow, host is congested, or timeout is too small for the request class | Increase CLI `--timeout-ms`, `--inspect-timeout-ms`, `--storage-timeout-ms`, or VS Code `requestTimeoutMs`. For one-off expensive inspection/storage fetches, raise the per-request timeout first. |
| Connect timeout / cannot attach | VS Code startup, remote CLI connect | Server never started, wrong host/port, firewall, loopback restrictions | Confirm the server is running, verify `host:port`, try `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`, and increase VS Code `connectTimeoutMs` if the backend starts slowly. |
| Incompatible debugger protocol | CLI remote connect, adapter logs, server handshake failure | Client and server builds are too far apart | Rebuild or reinstall the CLI and extension from the same repo revision or release line. Avoid mixing a newer extension with an older CLI server. |
| Authentication failed / unauthorized | Remote CLI response, VS Code output channel, server logs | Missing token, wrong token, or token mismatch between launcher and server | Make sure the same token is configured on both sides. In CLI use `--token`; in VS Code confirm the launch configuration or wrapper environment is passing the expected token. |
| Ping succeeds but inspect/storage fails | Remote CLI, VS Code Variables panel, paused session fetches | Per-request timeout for Inspect/GetStorage is lower than general execution latency | Increase CLI `--inspect-timeout-ms` and `--storage-timeout-ms`, or raise VS Code `requestTimeoutMs` if the adapter is fetching large payloads. |
| Repeated disconnect/retry loop | Remote CLI logs, VS Code reconnect attempts | Unstable loopback/network path, server crash, or aggressive retry policy | Check server logs first, then reduce network instability, and tune CLI retry flags `--retry-attempts`, `--retry-base-delay-ms`, and `--retry-max-delay-ms`. |
| Loopback bind/connect failures | CI, containers, restricted desktops, sandboxed environments | Localhost networking is restricted or intercepted | Prefer an explicitly allowed interface, check container port publishing, and validate that your environment permits loopback TCP before assuming a protocol bug. |
| TLS or plaintext confusion | Server starts, but clients fail or traffic assumptions are wrong | Server/client expectations do not match deployment topology | If you use `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key`, keep termination consistent. If you do not use TLS, assume plaintext unless you are on a trusted private network or behind external TLS termination. |

## CLI Checklist

### Server side

```bash
soroban-debug server --port 9229 --token secret
```

- Confirm the server is actually listening on the port you expect.
- If you enabled auth, verify the client uses the same token.
- If you enabled TLS, make sure your deployment path matches that expectation end to end.

### Client side

```bash
soroban-debug remote \
  --remote 127.0.0.1:9229 \
  --token secret \
  --timeout-ms 30000 \
  --inspect-timeout-ms 5000 \
  --storage-timeout-ms 10000
```

- Use `127.0.0.1` when `localhost` resolution or loopback policy is flaky.
- Raise `--inspect-timeout-ms` for expensive metadata/state fetches before raising every timeout globally.
- Raise `--storage-timeout-ms` if the storage view is the only part failing.
- Use the retry flags only for idempotent reconnect-style problems, not to mask protocol mismatches or auth failures.

## VS Code Checklist

Use these launch settings when the adapter is healthy but the backend is slow:

```json
{
  "type": "soroban",
  "request": "launch",
  "requestTimeoutMs": 45000,
  "connectTimeoutMs": 15000
}
```

- `requestTimeoutMs` covers backend request/response health during the session.
- `connectTimeoutMs` covers startup and initial server attach.
- If the session never gets past startup, raise `connectTimeoutMs` first.
- If stepping starts fine but Variables / stack / pause-state fetches fail, raise `requestTimeoutMs`.
- Turn on `"trace": true` and inspect the "Soroban Debugger" output channel for adapter-side phases such as `Spawn`, `Connect`, `Auth`, `Load`, and `Execution`.

## How to Distinguish Common Failures

### Timeout vs protocol mismatch

- Timeouts usually appear after a request is sent and then stalls.
- Protocol mismatches fail early during handshake and usually mention incompatibility or unknown response types.

### Auth failure vs network failure

- Auth failures mean the server was reachable enough to reject your credentials.
- Network failures usually show up as connection refused, connect timeout, or disconnect errors before auth completes.

### Loopback issue vs backend bug

- If both CLI and VS Code fail to reach `localhost`, suspect loopback/firewall/container policy first.
- If the CLI can connect but VS Code cannot, compare `binaryPath`, launch settings, and adapter logs before changing server settings.

## Recommended Escalation Order

1. Verify the server is running and reachable on the expected host and port.
2. Verify client/server token and build compatibility.
3. Increase the narrowest timeout that matches the failing request.
4. Enable CLI verbose logging or VS Code trace logging.
5. Only after that, broaden global timeouts or retry windows.

## Restricted Environments and `ci-sandbox`

If you are running local checks in CI containers, hardened desktops, or other restricted environments, use the sandbox-safe local gate:

```bash
make ci-sandbox
```

What this does:

- Runs deterministic Rust checks (`fmt`, `clippy`, `test`) in a predictable order.
- Exits successfully when those checks pass.
- Explicitly reports skipped gates that depend on local loopback networking or writable temp-dir behavior.

Use `ci-local` when your environment has full local networking and temp-dir support; use `ci-sandbox` when it does not.
